# Analysis of IKONOS satellite imagery for the Tundzha Regional Archaeological Project

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning system that
can identify potential burrial mounds in satellite images to a high
degree of accuracy. In this repository we are investigating two
avenues: classification of multi-band postage-stamp image centred on
burrial mounds and segmentation of large images to highlight burrial
mounds and other relevant features.

## Environment Setup

For GIS tasks remember to activate the GIS python environment. See
[HERE](https://github.com/crpurcell/IntroPythonGIS).

For ML tasks activate the DL4CV environment using ```workon dl4cv```.
